# Generic Node Documentation

The documentation site for the Generic Node is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).
All content is stored as Markdown files in `doc/content`.

## Development Environment Dependencies

Documentation development tooling uses [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

- Follow [Go's installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) to install Go.
- Follow [Yarn's installation guide](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) to install Yarn.

In order to build the documentation site with the right theme, you need to run
`make deps` from time to time. This will install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) on Mac and Unix systems if it is not already installed.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and tooling to help you comply with our git style guidelines by running

```
$ make init
```

## Running a Development Server

You can start a development server with live reloading by running
`make` or `make server`. This command will print the address of the server.

## Building the Documentation for Github Pages

The documentation site can be built for Github Pages by running `make build.public`. This will
output the site to `public`.

## Building the Documentation for Internal (Offline) Use

The documentation site can be built for internal (offline) use by running `make build.internal`. This will
output the site to `internal`.

## Creating New Documentation
