The device boots and turns on the red LED.

If the button is not pressed, the red LED will stay on for a small period and the device will boot the user-flashed application.

If the button is pressed for long enough, it will turn on the blue LED and turn off the red LED, indicating a successful input and it will continue to boot the ST internal bootloader.
