The application behavior can be adjusted by modifying `conf/app_conf.h`.

- `GNSE_ADVANCED_TRACER_ENABLE` enables UART (115200/8-N-1) logging of application activity

```c
#define GNSE_ADVANCED_TRACER_ENABLE 1
```

- `DEBUGGER_ON` enables the use of a debugger in low power mode

```c
#define DEBUGGER_ON       1
```

> **Note:** Please keep in mind that it is best to disable the tracer and debugger functionalities to reduce power consumption.
