If you are reading this, you are probably one of the first people to get their hands on the {{% gnse %}}.
We are extremely excited to have you as a part of our community!

<!--more-->

The {{% gnse %}} is a unique device for several reasons:
- It is a functional device that can be used for many LoRaWAN applications
- It is a production-ready device that incorporates STMicroelectronics' new STM32WL SOC
- It is a reference design hardware
- It has a source available firmware

## Production rollout

We started with shipping 100 devices to developers and community members as part of a beta rollout.

Now that this phase is completed, the {{% gnse %}} is currently being produced at scale.
We started with producing and shipping 500 devices and we are ramping up to reach 10,000 devices.

## Where to start?

Check out {{% gnse %}} [Hardware]({{< ref "/sensor-edition/hardware" >}}) and [Software]({{< ref "/sensor-edition/software" >}}) sections to get familiar with the device.

## Using the vanilla application

Each device comes pre-programmed with an example application that lets you experience some of the {{% gnse %}} capabilities and functionalities.

Check out this [guide]({{< ref "/applications/se-vanilla" >}}) on how to get started using the vanilla application.

## Are you a developer?

If you are a developer, please read [Hardware Setup]({{< ref "/getting-started/se-hw" >}}) and [Software Setup]({{< ref "/getting-started/se-sw" >}}) sections for instructions on how to install all the necessary tools and prepare yourself for hardware and software development.

Visit [Sensor Edition Tutorials]({{< ref "/getting-started/se-hands-on-guide" >}}) page for some great, easy-to-follow video guides. Also, check out the [Applications]({{< ref "/applications" >}}) section for many application examples.

## Where to contribute?

We use the [Generic Node Sensor Edition Github repository](https://github.com/TheThingsIndustries/generic-node-se) in our development. You can [file an issue](https://github.com/TheThingsIndustries/generic-node-se/issues/new/choose) to request a feature or report a bug.

The [Generic Node Forum](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/forum/c/nodes/generic-node) is where we have discussions and where you can provide feedback.

## Have fun!

You can try out some cool features that are only possible with the {{% gnse %}}, like:
- [QR code claiming](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/devices/device-claiming/claim-devices/)
- [Secure element claiming](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/devices/claim-atecc608a/)
- Adding external sensors
- Using FreeRTOS with LoRaWAN
- LoRaWAN FUOTA

We look forward to seeing all the awesome projects built with the {{% gnse %}}! We will share with you all the cool things developed within the community.
