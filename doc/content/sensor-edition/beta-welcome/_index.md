If you are reading this, you are probably one of the first people to get their hands on the {{% gnse %}}.
We are extremely excited to have you as part of the community.

<!--more-->

The {{% gnse %}} is a unique device for multiple reasons:
- It is a functional device that can be used for many LoRaWAN applications
- It is a production-ready device that incorporates STMicroelectronics' new STM32WL SOC
- It is a reference design hardware
- It has a source available firmware

## Developer's Beta Rollout

The {{% gnse %}} is currently in Beta phase.

This means a number of things:
1. You are one of the few people who can actually experience the device hardware and firmware
2. You can contribute to the development of the device

So, as part of this Beta phase we expect you to:
- Be able to flash, debug and interact with the device
- Be able to connect external serial loggers, debuggers and sensors
- Contribute to the development of the device by raising issues
- Develop and try different applications

And you can expect us to:
- Prioritize any issue that you face
- Analyze and incorporate your feedback

## Where to start?

The [Getting started]({{< ref "/getting-started" >}}) is a great place to get familiar with the device.

## Where to contribute?

We use the <a href="https://github.com/TheThingsIndustries/generic-node-se" target="_blank">{{% gnse %}} Github repository</a> in our development. You can <a href="https://github.com/TheThingsIndustries/generic-node-se/issues/new/choose" target="_blank">file an issue</a> to request a feature or report a bug.

The <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/forum/c/nodes/generic-node" target="_blank">{{% gn %}} Forum</a> is where we will have discussions and where you can provide feedback.
You will be added to a private group with other Beta developers.

## Things to try

We will send you a couple of emails to assist you with trying-out some cool things that are only possible with the {{% gnse %}} like:
- <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/devices/device-claiming/claim-devices/" target="_blank">QR code claiming</a>
- <a href="https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/devices/claim-atecc608a/" target="_blank">Secure element claiming </a>
- Adding external sensors
- Using FreeRTOS with LoRaWAN
- Using TinyML with LoRaWAN
- LoRaWAN FUOTA

## Going forward

We expect developers to build awesome things with the {{% gnse %}}, and we are looking forward to sharing with you all the cool things that will be developed by the community.
