If you are reading this, you are probably one of the first people to get their hands on the {{% gnse %}}.
We are extremely excited to have you as a part of our community!

<!--more-->

The {{% gnse %}} is a unique device for several reasons:
- It is a functional device that can be used for many LoRaWAN applications
- It is a production-ready device that incorporates STMicroelectronics' new STM32WL SOC
- It is a reference design hardware
- It has a source available firmware

## Developer's Beta rollout

The {{% gnse %}} is currently in Beta phase.

This means:
1. You are one of the few people who can actually experience the device hardware and firmware
2. You can contribute to the development of the device

So, as part of the Beta phase we expect you to:
- Be able to flash, debug and interact with the device
- Be able to connect external serial loggers, debuggers and sensors
- Contribute to the development of the device by raising issues
- Develop and try different applications

And you can expect us to:
- Prioritize any issue that you face
- Analyze and incorporate your feedback

## Where to start?

Check out {{% gnse %}} [Hardware]({{< ref "/sensor-edition/hardware" >}}) and [Software]({{< ref "/sensor-edition/software" >}}) sections to get familiar with the device.

Read [Hardware Setup]({{< ref "/getting-started/se-hw" >}}) and [Software Setup]({{< ref "/getting-started/se-sw" >}}) sections for instructions on how to install all the necessary tools and prepare yourself for hardware and software development.

Visit [Sensor Edition Tutorials]({{< ref "/getting-started/se-hands-on-guide" >}}) page for some great, easy-to-follow video guides. Also, check out the [Applications]({{< ref "/applications" >}}) section for many application examples.

## Where to contribute?

We use the [Generic Node Sensor Edition Github repository](https://github.com/TheThingsIndustries/generic-node-se) in our development. You can [file an issue](https://github.com/TheThingsIndustries/generic-node-se/issues/new/choose) to request a feature or report a bug.

The [Generic Node Forum](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/forum/c/nodes/generic-node) is where we have discussions and where you can provide feedback.
You will be added to a private group with other Beta developers.

## Have fun!

You will recieve a couple of emails to assist you with trying out some cool features that are only possible with the {{% gnse %}}, like:
- [QR code claiming](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/devices/device-claiming/claim-devices/)
- [Secure element claiming](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/devices/claim-atecc608a/)
- Adding external sensors
- Using FreeRTOS with LoRaWAN
- Using TinyML with LoRaWAN
- LoRaWAN FUOTA

We look forward to seeing awesome projects being built with the {{% gnse %}}! We will share with you all the cool things developed within the community.
