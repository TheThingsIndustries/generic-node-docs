The {{% gnte %}} [firmware](https://github.com/TheThingsIndustries/generic-node-te) allows for building multiple applications using the [Semtech LR1110](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-edge/lr1110) modem.

The STM32L073 host MCU communicates with the LR1110 modem over SPI bus, and it is able to perform functions such as Wi-Fi and GNSS scanning, and transmit the information using LoRaWAN.

A simple Tracker example app joins the LoRaWAN network and performs a clock sync, and then periodically performs a Wi-Fi and GNSS scans and streams the scanned results to the network.

The application server solves the streamed data location coordinates and provides an accurate location.
