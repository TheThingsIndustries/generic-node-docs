Weather you are a beginner or an experienced developer, we believe it should be fairly simple to explore and develop for any {{% gn %}} device.

<!--more-->
We believe LoRaWAN device development should be easy and straight forward.

## Choosing a device

To get started with the {{% gn %}} platform, you typically would need two things:

1. {{% gn %}} supported hardware
2. {{% gn %}} supported software

For example, if you are planning to use the {{% gnse %}}, you would need:

1. {{% gnse %}} board
2. {{% gnse %}} application

## Setting up your node

- [Sensor Edition Software Setup Guide]({{< ref "/getting-started/se-sw" >}})

## Exploring the node features

If you want to learn more about your node, head over to

- [Hardware]({{< ref "/hardware" >}})
- [Software]({{< ref "/software" >}})
- [Sensor Edition]({{< ref "/sensor-edition" >}})
- [Tracking Edition]({{< ref "/Tracking-edition" >}})
