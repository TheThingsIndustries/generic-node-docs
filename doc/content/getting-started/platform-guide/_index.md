## Choosing a device

To get started with the {{% gn %}} platform, you would typically need two things:

1. {{% gn %}} supported hardware
2. {{% gn %}} supported software

For example, if you are planning to use the {{% gnse %}}, you would need:

1. {{% gnse %}} board
2. {{% gnse %}} application

## Setting up your node

To learn to setup your {{% gnse %}}, follow these sections:

- [Sensor Edition Hardware Setup Guide]({{< ref "/getting-started/se-hw" >}})
- [Sensor Edition Software Setup Guide]({{< ref "/getting-started/se-sw" >}})

## Exploring the node features

If you want to learn more about your node, take a look at the following sections:
