The {{% gn %}} platform is designed to provide an easy way to get started with device development.

<!--more-->

## Choosing a device

To get started with the {{% gn %}} platform, you would typically need two things:

1. {{% gn %}} supported hardware
2. {{% gn %}} supported software

For example, if you are planning to use the {{% gnse %}}, you would need:

1. {{% gnse %}} board
2. {{% gnse %}} application

## Getting a device

{{% gnse %}} is currently in Beta phase. Join the early access program and become one of the first to access the node at [genericnode.com](https://www.genericnode.com/)

## Setting up your node

To learn to setup your {{% gnse %}}, follow these sections:

- [Sensor Edition Hardware Setup Guide]({{< ref "/getting-started/se-hw" >}})
- [Sensor Edition Software Setup Guide]({{< ref "/getting-started/se-sw" >}})
